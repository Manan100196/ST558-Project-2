# ST558-Project-2

This is second project of ST 558 - Data Science for Statistics. Myself, Manan Shah along with Xi Yang are working on this project. The main aim of this project is to get an idea how git and github are useful when multiple people work on a same project. The project involves creating functions to fetch information from an external source using API . Later, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
